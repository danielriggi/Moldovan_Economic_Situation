 ## Background and Motivation
 The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country in Eastern Europe bordered by Romania to the west and Ukraine to the north,east, and south. Moldova is also the <a href="https://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/top-10-poorest-countries-in-europe-1538044990-1">poorest country in Europe</a>, as well as the country with the lowest  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index> Human Development Index</a>. The territory of Moldova 
has changed hands often throughout history. Most recently, during the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Moldova declared independence on 27 August 1991. Like many former Soviet countries, the fall of the USSR ushered in a period of economic and civil unrest. I'm interested in Moldova because it was my last deployment as a soldier. I was there during a period leading up to an election, and political opinions starkly varied between pro Western and pro Russian candidates. I wanted to see what type of effect Russia has had since the breakup of the Soviet Union on it's neighboring countries. 
## The Data
The data was collected from <a href=https://data.humdata.org/>humdata.org</a>, a website with a wide variety of humanitarian data. I used a dataset containing informaiton about twenty eight economic and social indicators. I collected this information about Moldova and it's neighboring countries, as well as a few larger European economies, specifically Moldova, Romania, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Russia, Germany, France, and Great Britain.
